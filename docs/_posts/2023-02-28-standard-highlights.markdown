As we await the variety patch, I'd like to highlight two strong decks for current standard format, one from a newer archetype, and one from an archetype that was very strong not that long ago.

[First, a Noxus/Targon deck with Kayle and Leona, an archetype that has been consistently strong recently.](https://runeterra.ar/decks/code/CIDACAIDBQAQEAYJAECASDIBAYESUAIGAMUQKAYJDIOCYNSYAIAQCAZYAIDASBAIAIAQGCJDAMAQGEYZG4)

[And, in case you miss discounting your hands with Bar, here's a version of Ionia/PnZ deck with Seraphine, Viktor and Karma that is currently doing very well.](https://runeterra.ar/decks/code/CEAQEBQECUUAMAIBAIYQCAYEAMAQMAQOAIBAEAYJAICAIAQHAMDAIDQWFMDACAYCCQBACAQMFEBAEAQFBIBAMBAJCIBQMAQBBUQAIAIEAENSONA)
