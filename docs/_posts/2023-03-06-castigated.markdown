title: Should you be castigated for running Castigate?
categories: standard meta shurima

One deck that has been underperforming on ladder recently is [mono-Shurima](https://lor.gg/archetype/80/statistics) with Azir and Xerath as champions.

It appears that cutting champion draw and champion protection is hurting this deck's performance, so if you are running cards like the new card [Castigate](https://lor.gg/card/06SH056/statistics), [Dunekeeper](https://lor.gg/card/04SH026/statistics) and [Aspiring Chronomancer](https://lor.gg/card/04SH001/statistics), consider cutting those in favour of a couple of copies of [Rite of Calling](https://lor.gg/card/04SH121/decks), [Ancient Hourglass](https://lor.gg/card/04SH076/statistics) and [Rite of Negation](https://lor.gg/card/04SH059/statistics)!
