One archetype that has taken the post-patch ladder and gauntlets by storm is [Demacia/Targon combination with Garen and Kayle](https://lor.gg/archetype/33235/decks)! I, personally, had success in gauntlets with it getting banned over and over and being able to choose from two other decks. Consider also adding one copy of [Jarvan IV](https://lor.gg/card/04DE008/statistics) for extra edge!
